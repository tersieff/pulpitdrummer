        <p>My name is James Killian and I was found by Christ back in the early 90’s. Since that time I’ve had the pleasure  of playing in many music situations both in and out of the church. One in particular stands out that has continued to be a major part of my life. The bands name was Godspeed. It was here that I forged relationships with some of the best musicians and dearest friends anyone could ever hope for. We recorded 1 album and 2 EP’s throughout the 2000’s as well as played many local and regional concerts. Later, many of the members of Godspeed formed a new band called No Less Days. We recorded a self entitled album No Less Days while continuing our ministry leading worship at our church. I currently have the privilege to be a part of Placerita Bible Church’s worship team playing with some of the finest musicians in LA. </p>
